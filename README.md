### Custom Program
 I created Custom Programs/binaries For my engagements. Most of these were created during my engagement period. Now I share a few for educational purposes.

### Download Web Cradle With AMSI Patching without powershell.exe
I originally published Download Web Cradle With AMSI Patching without powershell.exe on Medium.
(https://nyameeeain.medium.com/web-download-cradle-with-amsi-patching-without-powershell-exe-225c31f06e25).

### CommandRunner
The CommandRunner program conducts local enumeration (e.g., services, network interfaces, permissions) and saves the output in the public folder, including timestamps for each command. Timestamps are for reporting purposes. 

### UserAdd

This program creates a local user and adds them to the local administrator group.
